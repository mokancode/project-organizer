## Project Organizer is a task management web-app. 

Production version deployed on [Heroku](https://project-organizer-mokancode.herokuapp.com/).

Created with ReactJS.

## How to use the app
Click on "**Login**". A panel will show up. Click on "**Register**" at the bottom of it.
* You can use **Gmail Auth** to sign up and use the app right away. To do this, click on the "Register with Google" button.
* Otherwise, fill out your details in the input boxes and click on "**Submit**". An **account activation link** will be emailed which has to be opened before the app can be used.

Once you're logged in, open the navigation panel on the top left.
Click on "**New Project**", name it, and click on "**Add**", or press **Ctrl + Enter**.
The focus will now automatically shift to the **Categories** input box. Name your new category (e.g. "To do") and press Ctrl + Enter. Add another category "Completed". Press Escape to close the navigation panel.

Type something inside the large text area. Notice that a new input box will appear right under. You can use it to add sub-notes. Press Ctrl + Enter or click on the "+" button to add your (sub)note.

**To make changes** to a note after adding it to the list, double click on the main text or any of the subnotes. When you're done click on the **tick icon**.
Alternatively, you can **hover** over the **3 vertical dots** on the right side of a note and click on the **pencil icon** to edit your note and add/remove subnotes.

**To move a note to another category** (e.g. from "To Do" to "Completed"), hover over the 3 vertical dots icon and then hover over the **curved arrow icon**. A **list** of all the other categories inside the current project will appear. Click on the desired category you wish to move the note to. To remove the entire note, double click on the **"X" icon**.

**To switch to another project** click on the **"P" button** on the left side of the screen, or **press on 1** on the keyboard. Similarly, **to switch to another category** click on the **"C" button**, or **press on 2** on the keyboard.
